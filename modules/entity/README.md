@ngrx/entity
=======

This is @ngrx/entity where dependencies on ngrx and angular are removed to be used in any redux project.
It also fixes a typescript problem when using createSelectors() and it complains about not importing Dictionary<T>.

The sources for this package are in the main [ngrx/platform](https://github.com/ngrx/platform) repo. Please file issues and pull requests against that repo.
