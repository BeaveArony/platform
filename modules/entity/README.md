# redux-ngrx-entity

This is a clone of @ngrx/entity version 7.0.0 where dependencies on ngrx and angular are removed to be
used in any redux or javascript project. Not just angular and ngrx.

The sources for this package are in the main
[ngrx/platform](https://github.com/ngrx/platform) repo. Please file issues and
pull requests against that repo.
